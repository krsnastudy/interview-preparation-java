### ✅ **What is Generative AI?**

**Generative AI** refers to a class of artificial intelligence models that can **generate new content** such as text, images, code, music, or video. Unlike traditional AI that classifies or predicts from existing data, **Generative AI *creates***.

> **Example**: ChatGPT generating a response, DALL·E generating images, GitHub Copilot writing code.

### 🧠 **How Generative AI Works**

1. **Trained on massive datasets** using deep learning, especially **transformers**.
2. **Learns patterns**, context, and structure from the data.
3. During generation, it **predicts the next word/token/image pixel/etc.**, based on context.

#### ✨ Core Technologies:

* **Transformer Architecture** (e.g., GPT, BERT, T5)
* **Large Language Models (LLMs)** (e.g., GPT-4, PaLM)
* **GANs** (for images, videos: Generative Adversarial Networks)
* **Diffusion Models** (like Stable Diffusion, DALL·E)
