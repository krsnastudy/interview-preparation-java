### **Short Answer (For Interviews)**
`@Autowired` in Spring Boot is used for **dependency injection**. It automatically injects a required bean by searching for matching types in the application context. Internally, it relies on the **Spring IoC Container**, **reflection**, and the **BeanFactory** to resolve dependencies.

---

### **Detailed Breakdown**
When you annotate a field or constructor with `@Autowired`, Spring performs the following steps internally:

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Scanning and Bean Creation**
- During application startup, Spring scans components (`@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`) and registers them as beans.
- These beans are stored in the **Application Context**.

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Dependency Resolution**
- When a bean with `@Autowired` is found, Spring:
    - **Looks for a matching bean type** in the context.
    - If **one bean is found**, it injects it.
    - If **multiple beans exist**, Spring requires `@Qualifier` to specify the correct one.

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Reflection & Setter/Constructor Injection**
- Spring uses **reflection** to inject dependencies at runtime.
- If applied on a **field**, Spring **directly injects the bean**.
- If used on a **constructor**, Spring invokes it automatically.
- For **methods**, Spring calls the setter method during bean initialization.

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Default Singleton Scope**
By default, Spring beans are **singletons**, meaning the same instance is reused across the application.

‚úÖ **Example: Using `@Autowired` on a Service**
```java
@Service
public class OrderService {
    @Autowired
    private PaymentService paymentService;  // Injected automatically by Spring
}
```

‚úÖ **Example: Constructor-based Injection (Recommended)**
```java
@Service
public class OrderService {
    private final PaymentService paymentService;

    @Autowired
    public OrderService(PaymentService paymentService) {
        this.paymentService = paymentService;
    }
}
```
