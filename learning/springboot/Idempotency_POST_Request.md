To ensure that data is only saved once despite multiple POST requests (even if multiple requests hit the system), you can implement an **idempotency mechanism**.

The idea is to generate a unique identifier for the operation (such as a request) that the client sends and use this identifier to ensure that the same request is processed only once.

### Approach to achieve it:

1. **Generate Unique Request Identifier (Idempotency Key):**
    - When the client sends a POST request, it includes a unique **idempotency key** (like a GUID) in the headers or body of the request.
    - This key can be generated by the client or the server, but it must be guaranteed to be unique for each operation.

2. **Store Processed Requests:**
    - When the server receives the POST request, it checks if the **idempotency key** is already stored (in a persistent store like Redis, Database, or in-memory).
    - If the key exists, it means that this request has been processed already, so the server should **return the previously saved response** without reprocessing the data.

3. **Save Data Only Once:**
    - If the key does not exist, the server proceeds to **save the data** (for example, inserting into the database) and stores the **idempotency key** with the corresponding result in a persistent store (Redis, database, etc.).
    - The server then returns the response to the client, indicating that the operation was successful.

4. **Time-to-Live (TTL) for Idempotency Keys:**
    - To avoid storing keys indefinitely, you can set a TTL (time-to-live) for the keys. For instance, once the request has been successfully processed, you can keep the key for a certain period (e.g., 24 hours) in the cache or database, after which it can be safely deleted.

### Implementation Example (using Java and Spring Boot):

#### Step 1: Add Idempotency Key to the POST Request

In your client request, include an idempotency key:

```http
POST /your-api-endpoint
Idempotency-Key: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

#### Step 2: Server-side Implementation

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;
import org.springframework.cache.CacheManager;

import java.util.UUID;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class YourController {

    @Autowired
    private CacheManager cacheManager; // You can use Redis or other cache manager

    @PostMapping("/saveData")
    public ResponseEntity<String> saveData(@RequestBody Data data, 
                                           @RequestHeader("Idempotency-Key") String idempotencyKey) {
        // Check if the Idempotency Key exists in the cache or database
        if (cacheManager.getCache("idempotencyKeys").get(idempotencyKey) != null) {
            // If it exists, return the saved response without reprocessing
            return ResponseEntity.ok("Data already saved with this Idempotency Key.");
        }

        // If it doesn't exist, process the request and save the data
        // Save your data (database insert logic here)
        saveDataToDatabase(data);
        
        // Store the Idempotency Key in cache or database
        cacheManager.getCache("idempotencyKeys").put(idempotencyKey, "Data processed");

        return ResponseEntity.ok("Data saved successfully.");
    }

    private void saveDataToDatabase(Data data) {
        // Your database saving logic here
        System.out.println("Saving data to database: " + data);
    }
}

class Data {
    private String name;
    private String email;

    // Getters and setters
}
```

#### Step 3: Using Cache for Idempotency Keys

To implement caching, use something like **Redis** or **Springâ€™s in-memory cache**. If you use Redis, you can set a TTL for each key to automatically expire after a certain period.

```yaml
# application.properties
spring.cache.type=redis
spring.cache.redis.time-to-live=3600 # 1 hour TTL for idempotency keys
```

### Key Concepts:
- **Idempotency Key**: A unique key (e.g., a UUID) sent by the client to identify the request. It is used to check if the same operation has already been performed.
- **Cache/Database**: Store the processed requests along with the idempotency key to ensure that the same request is not reprocessed.
- **Time-to-Live (TTL)**: Set TTL for the cache or database entry to delete old keys and avoid endless storage.

### TL;DR:
1. The client sends a unique idempotency key with the POST request.
2. The server checks if the idempotency key is already stored (cache or database).
3. If the key exists, return the previous response; otherwise, process the request and store the key.
4. Set TTL for the idempotency keys to ensure they don't occupy space indefinitely.

This ensures that no matter how many POST requests with the same idempotency key hit the server, the data is saved only once.
