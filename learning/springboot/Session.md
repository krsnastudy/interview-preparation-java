## ✅ What is a Session?

A **Session** is a way to **maintain state** (user data) **across multiple requests** made by the same client (browser) to a server.

Since **HTTP is stateless** (it doesn’t remember anything between two requests), a **Session** helps the server remember **who the user is** and **what they were doing** during their visit.

---

## ✅ Key Points:

- A **session starts** when the user first connects (logs in, or first request).
- The server creates a **session object** and assigns it a **unique ID** (session ID).
- This **session ID** is stored on the client side (browser) via **cookies** or **URL rewriting**.
- For every new request, the client sends back the **session ID**, so the server retrieves the user's session data.

---

## ✅ Example Scenario:
1. You log in to an online shopping site → Server creates a **session** for you.
2. You add items to your cart → Cart items are stored in your **session**.
3. You go to payment → Server fetches your **cart** from the **session**.
4. If the session expires or you log out, the cart is cleared.

---

## ✅ In Java (Servlets):

```java
HttpSession session = request.getSession();
session.setAttribute("username", "Krishna");
```
- Here, you store "Krishna" in the session under the key `"username"`.
- Later, you can retrieve it with `session.getAttribute("username")`.

---

## ✅ Session Lifecycle:
| Phase         | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Creation**  | When first needed (like after login) |
| **Usage**     | Server reads/writes data into session |
| **Timeout/Expiry** | If no activity happens for a configured time, session ends |
| **Destruction** | After logout or session invalidation (`session.invalidate()`) |

---

## ✅ Session vs Cookie (Quick View)

| Feature          | Session (Server-side) | Cookie (Client-side) |
|------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Storage location | Server memory          | Client browser       |
| Size limit       | Large                  | Small (~4KB)         |
| Security         | More secure            | Less secure          |
| Lifespan         | Configurable           | Configurable         |

---

### ✅ TL;DR:

> A **session** is server-side storage that keeps track of **user-specific data** across multiple HTTP requests, identified using a **session ID**.

**how Session works internally in Spring Boot** — especially with **`@SessionAttributes`** and other session management features:

---

# ✅ How Session Management Works in Spring Boot

Spring Boot uses the **Servlet API's `HttpSession`** under the hood to manage sessions.

When a user sends a request:
- Spring Boot automatically checks if a **session** exists (`HttpSession`).
- If not, it **creates a new session** (depending on your settings).
- It uses a **session ID cookie** (default name: `JSESSIONID`) to track the session between client and server.

**👉 So even in Spring Boot, it's ultimately using the regular servlet `HttpSession`, but Spring provides **annotations** and **abstractions** to make session handling easier.**

---

## ✅ Ways to Handle Sessions in Spring Boot

### 1. **Using HttpSession directly**
You can manually manage session attributes using `HttpSession` object.

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class UserController {

    @PostMapping("/login")
    public String login(HttpSession session) {
        session.setAttribute("user", "Krishna");
        return "User logged in and session created!";
    }

    @GetMapping("/home")
    public String home(HttpSession session) {
        String user = (String) session.getAttribute("user");
        return "Welcome back, " + user;
    }
}
```

➡️ Here, data (`"Krishna"`) is stored in the **server-side session**, accessible across multiple requests!

---

### 2. **Using `@SessionAttributes` on Controller**
- You can tell Spring to **automatically store model attributes** in the session.
- Best when you want session data **tied to a specific controller**.

```java
@Controller
@SessionAttributes("username")
public class ProfileController {

    @GetMapping("/setUsername")
    public String setUsername(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("username", "Krishna");
        return "profile";
    }

    @GetMapping("/profile")
    public String getProfile(@ModelAttribute("username") String username) {
        System.out.println("Username from session: " + username);
        return "profile";
    }
}
```

✅ What happens internally?
- When you `model.addAttribute("username", "Krishna")`, Spring **saves** it into the **HTTP Session** automatically.
- In next request, Spring **restores** it from the session into the method parameters automatically.

---

### 3. **Using `@SessionScope` for Beans**
If you want a **Spring Bean** (like a ShoppingCart) to be session-scoped:

```java
@Component
@SessionScope
public class ShoppingCart {
    private List<String> items = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addItem(String item) {
        items.add(item);
    }
}
```
- Each user session will have its **own copy** of this bean!

---

# ✅ Session Configuration in Spring Boot

You can configure session behavior in `application.properties`:

```properties
server.servlet.session.timeout=30m   # Session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity
server.servlet.session.cookie.name=MYSESSIONID  # Custom session cookie name
server.servlet.session.persistent=true # To make session survive browser restart
```

You can also move sessions to **Redis**, **Hazelcast**, etc., for scaling.

---

# ✅ Internally, How Spring Manages Session

- When a request comes in, Spring's `DispatcherServlet` checks if a **session exists**.
- If `@SessionAttributes` is used, `SessionAttributeStore` is used to **store and retrieve** session attributes.
- Otherwise, it simply uses **Servlet HttpSession** APIs.
- Session IDs are maintained through **cookies** (or sometimes URL rewriting).

---

# ✅ Quick Flow Diagram:
```
Client → Request → DispatcherServlet → Checks Session → Create/Retrieve Session
 → Controller (HttpSession OR @SessionAttributes) → Store/Fetch Data
 → Response with Session ID (cookie) → Client
```

---

# ✅ TL;DR:

> In **Spring Boot**, session management is built on top of **HttpSession**.  
> You can manually use `HttpSession`, or use **`@SessionAttributes`** (controller level), or **`@SessionScope`** (bean level) to manage session-scoped data easily.
