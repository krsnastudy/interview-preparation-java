In Spring, **Active Profiles** are used to define which set of configurations should be applied in a particular environment (such as development, testing, production, etc.). Profiles allow you to define different beans or configurations that can be activated based on the environment in which the application is running.

By using **Spring Profiles**, you can control which **beans** or **configuration settings** are available based on specific criteria, such as the application’s environment. For example, you might want different database configurations for development and production environments, or you might want to enable debugging features only in development.

### ✅ **Key Concepts of Spring Active Profiles:**

1. **Defining Profiles**:
    - You can define a profile using the `@Profile` annotation on a bean or configuration class.
    - Profiles can be activated via the **application properties file**, **command-line arguments**, or programmatically.

2. **Multiple Profiles**:
    - An application can have multiple profiles, and different profiles can be active at runtime.
    - You can group beans under different profiles and decide which set of beans to load based on the active profile.

3. **Environment-specific Configuration**:
    - **Spring Profiles** allow you to separate configuration properties for different environments, such as development, staging, and production.

### ✅ **How to Use Active Profiles:**

#### 1. **Defining a Profile with `@Profile` Annotation:**

The `@Profile` annotation can be used to specify that a certain bean is only available when a particular profile is active.

```java
@Component
@Profile("dev")
public class DevDatabaseConfig implements DatabaseConfig {
    // Bean specific to 'dev' profile
}

@Component
@Profile("prod")
public class ProdDatabaseConfig implements DatabaseConfig {
    // Bean specific to 'prod' profile
}
```

In the above example:
- `DevDatabaseConfig` will only be available if the `dev` profile is active.
- `ProdDatabaseConfig` will only be available if the `prod` profile is active.

#### 2. **Activating Profiles in `application.properties` or `application.yml`:**

You can specify the active profiles in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.

**In `application.properties`:**

```properties
spring.profiles.active=dev
```

**In `application.yml`:**

```yaml
spring:
  profiles:
    active: dev
```

#### 3. **Activating Profiles Programmatically:**

You can also activate profiles programmatically by calling `SpringApplication.setAdditionalProfiles()`.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication app = new SpringApplication(Application.class);
    app.setAdditionalProfiles("dev");  // Activate 'dev' profile
    app.run(args);
}
```

#### 4. **Using Profiles in `@Configuration` Classes:**

Profiles can also be used in configuration classes to conditionally define beans.

```java
@Configuration
@Profile("dev")
public class DevConfig {
    @Bean
    public SomeService someService() {
        return new SomeServiceImpl();
    }
}

@Configuration
@Profile("prod")
public class ProdConfig {
    @Bean
    public SomeService someService() {
        return new ProdServiceImpl();
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `DevConfig` will be loaded when the `dev` profile is active.
- `ProdConfig` will be loaded when the `prod` profile is active.

#### 5. **Using Profiles with `@Value` or `@PropertySource`:**

You can use profiles to load specific properties based on the active profile:

```properties
# application-dev.properties
some.property=dev-value
```

```properties
# application-prod.properties
some.property=prod-value
```

In the main `application.properties`, you can activate the appropriate profile:

```properties
spring.profiles.active=dev
```

The property `some.property` will take the value `dev-value` when the `dev` profile is active and `prod-value` when the `prod` profile is active.

### ✅ **Common Use Cases for Profiles:**

1. **Database Configuration**:
    - You may have different database configurations for development (H2, SQLite) and production (MySQL, PostgreSQL). You can use profiles to switch between them.

2. **Logging Configuration**:
    - Enable more verbose logging for the `dev` profile and reduce log levels for production to improve performance.

3. **Service Activation**:
    - You can activate or deactivate certain beans based on the environment. For example, using different versions of an API client in development and production.

4. **Test Configuration**:
    - For unit tests, you can define a profile (e.g., `test`) to mock services or use in-memory databases.

---

### ✅ **Example:**

**`application.properties`**:

```properties
# Default active profile
spring.profiles.active=dev
```

**`DatabaseConfig.java`**:

```java
@Configuration
public class DatabaseConfig {

    @Bean
    @Profile("dev")
    public DataSource devDataSource() {
        return new DataSource("dev-url", "dev-user", "dev-password");
    }

    @Bean
    @Profile("prod")
    public DataSource prodDataSource() {
        return new DataSource("prod-url", "prod-user", "prod-password");
    }
}
```

In this example, depending on the active profile (`dev` or `prod`), the appropriate `DataSource` bean will be loaded.

---

### ✅ **TL;DR:**
- **Spring Active Profiles** allow you to manage environment-specific configurations by defining beans that are conditionally loaded based on the active profile.
- You can define profiles using the `@Profile` annotation and specify which profile is active via `application.properties`, programmatically, or in a command-line argument.
- Profiles are useful for separating development, test, and production configurations in a Spring application, making it easier to maintain environment-specific settings.
