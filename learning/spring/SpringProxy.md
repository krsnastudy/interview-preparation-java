In Spring, **proxies** are a foundational mechanism used to implement features like:

- Transaction management (`@Transactional`)
- AOP (`@Around`, `@Before`)
- Lazy initialization
- Security (`@Secured`, method-level access)
- `@Async`, etc.

## üîç What Does It Mean: ‚ÄúSpring creates a proxy around the bean‚Äù?

When Spring says it **creates a proxy**, it means:
- Instead of returning your actual bean (`MyServiceImpl`), Spring returns a *proxy object* that wraps the original.
- This proxy intercepts method calls and can apply **cross-cutting logic** (like logging, security, transactions) **before or after** the actual method runs.

---

### ‚úÖ Real Example:

```java
@Service
public class MyService {
    @Transactional
    public void doWork() {
        // business logic
    }
}
```

> When Spring creates this bean, it creates a proxy that:
> - Starts a transaction before `doWork()`
> - Commits or rolls back after it finishes

## üîß Types of Proxies in Spring

| Proxy Type | Mechanism | Used For | Requirement |
|------------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **JDK Dynamic Proxy** | Implements interfaces | Default for interface-based beans | Bean must implement at least one interface |
| **CGLIB Proxy** | Subclasses the class | Used when no interface | Class must not be final |
| **ByteBuddy (Spring 6)** | Improved performance, replaces CGLIB | Used in newer versions | Same as CGLIB |

### ‚öôÔ∏è How the Proxy Works Internally

1. **Bean is requested**
    - e.g. from `@Autowired`, or via ApplicationContext
2. **Spring checks if the bean needs a proxy**
    - Checks for `@Transactional`, `@Async`, AOP advice, etc.
3. **Creates a proxy object**
    - JDK Proxy (if interfaces) or CGLIB Proxy (if not)
4. **Proxy intercepts method calls**
    - The real method is invoked *after* cross-cutting logic is applied.

### üìò Code Walkthrough (CGLIB Example)

```java
public class MyService$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB extends MyService {
    @Override
    public void doWork() {
        try {
            startTransaction();
            super.doWork();  // call actual method
            commitTransaction();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            rollbackTransaction();
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistake

Calling a `@Transactional` method **from within the same class** won't trigger proxy behavior:

```java
@Service
public class MyService {

    public void wrapperMethod() {
        doWork(); // ‚ùå proxy is bypassed
    }

    @Transactional
    public void doWork() { }
}
```

Use a separate bean or call it through the proxy to get the transaction applied.

---

### üß† TL;DR

- **Spring proxies beans** to apply behaviors like transactions, security, logging, etc.
- **JDK Proxy** is used for interface-based beans.
- **CGLIB/ByteBuddy** is used when there‚Äôs no interface.
- Proxies intercept method calls to apply additional logic.
