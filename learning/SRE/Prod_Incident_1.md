Here is a structured **step-by-step approach** to handle a **Production Incident**, especially relevant for Java/Spring Boot-based Microservices:

---

### ‚úÖ **Step-by-Step Incident Response Process**

#### **1. Acknowledge the Incident**

* Respond immediately to incident alert (email, Slack, PagerDuty, etc.).
* Acknowledge in incident tracker (Jira, ServiceNow, etc.) to avoid duplication.

#### **2. Impact Assessment**

* Identify:

    * What systems are affected?
    * Who are the impacted users (external/internal)?
    * Severity and business criticality.

#### **3. Initial Investigation**

* **Check logs**: Application logs, container logs (e.g., using ELK, Splunk, or CloudWatch).
* **Monitor systems**: Use monitoring tools (Grafana, Prometheus, New Relic) to look at:

    * CPU, memory usage, thread count.
    * Database connections, latency, error rate.
* Review recent **deployments**, **config changes**, or **infrastructure changes**.

#### **4. Isolate the Issue**

* If possible, isolate the service or component causing the issue.
* Use feature flags, circuit breakers (e.g., Hystrix/Resilience4j), or routing to reduce impact.

#### **5. Fix or Rollback**

* **Hotfix**: If a quick patch is possible and tested.
* **Rollback**: Roll back to a previous working version using CI/CD pipeline.
* Ensure changes go through **review and testing**, even in urgency.

#### **6. Verify and Monitor**

* Validate the fix by running functional smoke tests.
* Keep an eye on metrics/logs to confirm system is stable.

#### **7. Communication**

* Keep stakeholders informed:

    * Incident declared ‚úÖ
    * RCA in progress üõ†Ô∏è
    * Fix deployed ‚úÖ
    * Services recovered üöÄ
* Use a comms channel (Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Email).

#### **8. Post-Incident Activities**

* **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**:

    * What went wrong?
    * Why did it go undetected?
    * How to prevent it?
* **Action Items**:

    * Add monitoring/alerts.
    * Improve logging.
    * Add test cases.

#### **9. Documentation**

* Update Confluence or runbooks with:

    * Summary of incident.
    * RCA details.
    * Fix applied.
    * Preventive actions.

### üìù Interview Short Answer

> ‚ÄúWhen a production incident occurs, I first acknowledge and assess the impact, check logs and metrics to isolate the root cause, and either apply a hotfix or roll back if necessary. I ensure proper stakeholder communication and post-resolution, I perform RCA and add monitoring to prevent future occurrences.‚Äù

Would you like me to format this as a real-time war-room scenario or include tools like Kubernetes, ELK, Prometheus, etc.?
