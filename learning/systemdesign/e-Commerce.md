Designing an **E-Commerce System** is a **frequent high-level system design interview problem**, especially for experienced backend engineers. Let's go through an **interview-structured, scalable, and extendable system design** of an **E-Commerce platform** like Amazon or Flipkart.

---

## 🧭 **Scope**

Design an e-commerce backend that supports:

* User registration, login
* Product catalog with categories
* Cart & Wishlist
* Order placement and payment
* Inventory management
* Order tracking

---

## ✅ Functional Requirements

1. User Management (registration, login, profile)
2. Product Browsing (categories, search, filters)
3. Shopping Cart & Wishlist
4. Order Management
5. Inventory Management
6. Payment Integration
7. Notifications (Email, SMS)

---

## 🚦 Non-Functional Requirements

* High availability & scalability
* Data consistency (especially inventory & payment)
* Low latency for search and browsing
* Secure handling of user and payment data

                   |    Load Balancer    |
                   +----------+----------+
                              |
            +----------------v------------------+

    | Cart Service        Order Service                 |
    | Payment Service     Inventory Service             |
    | Notification Service                               |
    +------------------------+--------------------------+
                             |

                   |  Data Storage    |
                   |------------------|
                   | RDBMS (ACID)     |
                   | NoSQL (Cache)    |
                   +------------------+

## 🧾 Key Microservices & Responsibilities

### 🔹 User Service

* Signup, login, auth (OAuth/JWT)
* Profile management

### 🔹 Product Service

* Add/view/edit products
* Categories, specs, filters
* Product images (via CDN/S3)

### 🔹 Cart Service

* Add/remove/update items
* Sync with Inventory Service

### 🔹 Order Service

* Creates order from cart
* Generates order ID, status
* Calls Inventory & Payment

### 🔹 Inventory Service

* Tracks stock quantity
* Locks stock during checkout
* Rollback on payment failure

### 🔹 Payment Service

* Integrates with third-party (Razorpay, Stripe, PayPal)
* Handles payment events
* Stores transaction metadata

### 🔹 Notification Service

* Sends order/payment confirmation via email/SMS
* Event-driven (Kafka or SQS)

---

## 💾 Database Design (Simplified ER Model)

### Users

```sql
User(id, name, email, hashed_password, address, created_at)
```

### Products

```sql
Product(id, title, description, price, category_id, seller_id, stock, created_at)
```

### Cart

```sql
Cart(id, user_id, product_id, quantity, added_at)
```

### Orders

```sql
Order(id, user_id, status, total_amount, created_at)
OrderItem(order_id, product_id, quantity, price)
```

---

## ⚙️ Key Concepts

### 🔄 Consistency

* Use **transactions** for order + inventory + payment updates.
* **Inventory Locking** during checkout.

### ⚡ Performance

* **Redis** for:

    * Product search cache
    * Session management
* **CDN** for images
* **ElasticSearch** for search and filters

### 📦 Order Flow

```
1. User places order from cart
2. Inventory is locked (reserved)
3. Payment initiated
4. On success:
   - Order status = CONFIRMED
   - Inventory decremented
5. On failure:
   - Order = FAILED
   - Inventory released
```

---

## 📢 Event-Driven Design (Kafka/SQS)

Used for:

* Sending notifications
* Updating analytics
* Managing stock updates asynchronously

---

## 🔐 Security

* HTTPS everywhere
* Hash passwords (bcrypt)
* Use JWT for sessions
* PCI-DSS compliance for payment

---

## 🧠 Scalability & Reliability

* Use **Service Discovery** (e.g., Consul)
* **Rate limiting** & throttling at gateway
* **Retry** and **circuit breaker** patterns
* **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana

---

## ✅ TL;DR (Interview Summary)

* **Modular microservices**: user, product, cart, order, inventory, payment
* Use **ACID transactions** for order flow, especially for inventory & payment
* **Elasticsearch** for product search; **Redis** for caching
* **Kafka/Event queues** for async processes (notifications, stock updates)
* Scalable, fault-tolerant, and secure backend architecture
