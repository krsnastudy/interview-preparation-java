Designing a service to serve **multiple tenants** (multi-tenant architecture) requires careful planning to ensure data isolation, scalability, performance, and security. Below is a structured design approach to create a service that can handle multiple tenants:

### 1. **Define the Tenancy Model**
- **Single-Tenant Model**: Each tenant has its own isolated instance (database, schema, or resources).
- **Multi-Tenant Model**: Multiple tenants share the same instance, but their data and configurations are isolated.

For a scalable multi-tenant system, the **Shared Database** and **Shared Schema** model are commonly used, where tenants share the same database, but their data is logically separated. This is more efficient in terms of resource usage.

### 2. **Tenant Identification**
- **Identify tenants** through a **tenant identifier** (tenant ID), typically passed through request headers, a URL parameter, or session data.
- **Tenant Context**: Use a tenant context or thread-local variable to store the tenant ID once it’s identified, ensuring it's available throughout the request lifecycle.

Example:
- **URL**: `https://api.yourapp.com/tenant/{tenantId}/resource`
- **HTTP Header**: `Tenant-ID: tenantId`

### 3. **Data Isolation**
Data isolation is crucial to ensure that each tenant's data remains secure and independent from other tenants.

**Options for Data Isolation:**
- **Shared Database, Shared Schema (Logical Isolation)**:
    - Use a **tenant identifier** in each table to differentiate data for each tenant (e.g., `tenant_id` column).
    - **Example**: If you're storing customer data, your `customers` table might look like this:
      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE customers (
          tenant_id INT,
          customer_id INT,
          name VARCHAR(255),
          email VARCHAR(255),
          PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, customer_id)
      );
      ```
    - You would filter data by tenant ID on every query, ensuring that one tenant’s data does not leak into another’s.
- **Separate Database or Schema** (Physical Isolation):
    - Each tenant gets their own database or schema. This ensures complete isolation but at the cost of increased resource usage and complexity in managing multiple databases.

### 4. **Authentication and Authorization**
- **Authentication**: Use a common authentication mechanism (e.g., OAuth, JWT) that identifies the tenant and the user.
    - Each tenant may have its own set of users, so the token should include a tenant identifier.
- **Authorization**: Ensure that users only have access to resources that belong to their tenant.
    - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) based on the tenant context.

### 5. **Configuration Management**
- **Tenant-Specific Configurations**: Allow each tenant to have its own configurations, such as custom settings, preferences, and branding. This can be done by storing tenant configurations in a separate table or external configuration store.
    - Example configuration storage:
      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE tenant_configurations (
          tenant_id INT,
          config_key VARCHAR(255),
          config_value VARCHAR(255),
          PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, config_key)
      );
      ```
- **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Depending on the environment (e.g., development, testing, production), the configuration for each tenant can be loaded differently (e.g., different cache settings or data source).

### 6. **Scalability Considerations**
- **Load Balancing**: Use a **load balancer** to distribute traffic across multiple instances of the application. You could also have a custom load balancing strategy for specific tenants if needed.
- **Sharding**: If you're dealing with a large number of tenants and high data volume, you may need to implement data sharding, where the data is split across multiple databases based on the tenant ID or other criteria.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Use container orchestration systems like Kubernetes to scale the service horizontally based on the load.

### 7. **Caching**
- **Tenant-Specific Caching**: Implement a cache per tenant, so that each tenant’s data is cached separately. Use a distributed caching system like **Redis** to store tenant-specific data, ensuring that one tenant’s cache doesn’t interfere with another’s.
- **Cache Keys**: Ensure that cache keys include the tenant ID to separate data for different tenants.
    - Example: `tenant:tenantId:user:12345`

### 8. **Logging and Monitoring**
- **Tenant-Aware Logging**: Include tenant information (tenant ID) in logs to ensure that logs are traceable to the correct tenant.
    - For example, use MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context) to add tenant ID to logs in a multi-tenant application.
- **Tenant-Specific Metrics**: Track performance and error metrics for each tenant. This allows you to monitor the health of each tenant individually and detect issues more easily.

### 9. **Backup and Data Retention**
- **Backup Strategies**: Define different backup strategies for each tenant. For example, tenants with critical data may require more frequent backups.
- **Data Retention**: Implement data retention policies where tenant data is archived or deleted after a certain period, based on the tenant’s requirements.

### 10. **Tenant Provisioning**
- **Tenant Onboarding**: Provide an onboarding mechanism for new tenants. This might involve creating a new schema, database, or setting up tenant-specific configurations.
- **Self-Service**: Provide a self-service portal where tenants can manage their configurations, settings, and users.

### 11. **Failure Isolation and Fault Tolerance**
- **Tenant Isolation**: Ensure that a failure in one tenant does not affect others. This can be achieved through isolation at the database level or by monitoring and throttling resource usage to prevent one tenant from overloading the system.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Implement fallback mechanisms to gracefully handle tenant-specific failures (e.g., rate limiting or retry logic).

### Example Design Using Spring Boot:
Here's an example of how you can implement multi-tenancy in Spring Boot using a **Shared Database and Shared Schema** approach.

#### 1. **Create a Tenant Context Class**:
```java
public class TenantContext {
    private static final ThreadLocal<String> tenantId = new ThreadLocal<>();

    public static String getTenantId() {
        return tenantId.get();
    }

    public static void setTenantId(String tenant) {
        tenantId.set(tenant);
    }

    public static void clear() {
        tenantId.remove();
    }
}
```

#### 2. **Interceptor to Set Tenant Context**:
```java
@Component
public class TenantInterceptor implements HandlerInterceptor {

    @Override
    public boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler) throws Exception {
        String tenantId = request.getHeader("Tenant-ID");  // Example: "tenant1"
        TenantContext.setTenantId(tenantId);
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public void afterCompletion(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler, Exception ex) throws Exception {
        TenantContext.clear();
    }
}
```

#### 3. **Custom DataSource Based on Tenant**:
```java
@Configuration
@EnableTransactionManagement
public class TenantDataSourceConfig {

    @Bean
    @Primary
    public DataSource dataSource() {
        DataSourceRouting dataSourceRouting = new DataSourceRouting();
        dataSourceRouting.setTargetDataSources(getDataSourceMap());
        return dataSourceRouting;
    }

    private Map<Object, Object> getDataSourceMap() {
        Map<Object, Object> dataSourceMap = new HashMap<>();
        String tenantId = TenantContext.getTenantId();
        if (tenantId != null) {
            dataSourceMap.put(tenantId, createDataSource(tenantId));
        }
        return dataSourceMap;
    }

    private DataSource createDataSource(String tenantId) {
        // Return DataSource based on tenantId, e.g., create connections dynamically
        return new DataSource();
    }
}
```

### TL;DR:
To design a service that serves multiple tenants, you need to implement a **multi-tenancy architecture** where:
1. Tenants are identified via a unique tenant ID.
2. Use **shared database and schema** with a tenant identifier to isolate data.
3. Implement **tenant-specific authentication, authorization**, and configuration management.
4. Implement **scalability** via horizontal scaling, caching, and load balancing.
5. Ensure **data isolation**, **security**, **logging**, and **fault tolerance** for each tenant.
6. Provide mechanisms for **tenant provisioning**, monitoring, and backup.
