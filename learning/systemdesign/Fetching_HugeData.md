# ðŸš€ Problem Statement

> **Design a system to fetch very large data (millions of rows, huge records) from a database or external source, without causing memory issues or performance bottlenecks.**

---

# ðŸ›  System Design Approach

You must **optimize for**:
- Low **memory footprint** (no OutOfMemoryError)
- **Efficient database access** (avoid loading everything at once)
- **Scalable** design (can work with growing data)
- **Batching** and **Streaming** data

---

# âœ… Techniques You Must Use

| Concept | Explanation |
|:---|:---|
| **Pagination** | Fetch data in small pages (chunks) like 1000 or 10,000 records at a time |
| **Streaming** | Read and process record-by-record instead of loading all into memory |
| **Batch Processing** | Fetch -> Process -> Release memory after each batch |
| **Lazy Fetching** | Load objects only when they are actually needed |
| **Connection Management** | Keep DB connection open only while reading |

---

# ðŸ§  Design Strategies (with Java)

## 1. **Pagination using LIMIT and OFFSET (SQL Side)**

Example query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 1000 OFFSET 0;
SELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 1000 OFFSET 1000;
...
```

Java Code Outline:

```java
public List<Employee> fetchBatch(int limit, int offset) {
    // Use JDBC Template or JPA Query to fetch with LIMIT and OFFSET
}
```

You keep **looping** over batches till **no records are left**.

---

## 2. **Streaming using JDBC (ResultSet Streaming)**

âœ… In JDBC, you can avoid loading all results into memory by **fetching row by row**:

```java
Connection conn = dataSource.getConnection();
PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM employees", 
                        ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY,
                        ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY);
stmt.setFetchSize(1000); // Fetch 1000 rows at a time

ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();
while (rs.next()) {
    // Process each record here without loading full list
}
rs.close();
stmt.close();
conn.close();
```
- **Important**: Set `fetchSize()` and `TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY`.

---

## 3. **Spring Data JPA + Streamable Results**

If you are using **Spring Boot + JPA**:

```java
@Query("SELECT e FROM Employee e")
Stream<Employee> streamAllEmployees();
```

Usage:

```java
try (Stream<Employee> employeeStream = employeeRepository.streamAllEmployees()) {
    employeeStream.forEach(employee -> {
        // Process each employee here
    });
}
```

âœ… Spring JPA **automatically** manages connection, fetches in streaming way.

---

## 4. **Batch Processing Architecture (Best for Huge Data)**

> Process data in small chunks, complete processing, then move to next chunk.

Frameworks:
- **Spring Batch** (Designed exactly for this)
- Custom batch loading + processing loops

Flow:

```text
Fetch N records --> Process --> Store or send --> Free memory --> Fetch next N records
```

---

# ðŸ”¥ Interview Bonus Points You Can Mention

| Tip | Explanation |
|:---|:---|
| Prefer Stream over List | Don't load all records into memory |
| Tune Fetch Size | JDBC or JPA fetch size optimization |
| Use Database Cursors | For really large result sets |
| Multi-thread Processing | For very high-performance needs (carefully) |
| Cloud-based storage | Store intermediate results if huge data (e.g., S3, Blob Storage) |

---

# âœ¨ Sample Full Flow Code (Pagination way)

```java
int limit = 1000;
int offset = 0;
List<Employee> employees;

do {
    employees = employeeRepository.fetchEmployees(limit, offset);
    for (Employee emp : employees) {
        process(emp);
    }
    offset += limit;
} while (!employees.isEmpty());
```

âœ… **Efficient** and **scalable** approach for large datasets.

---

# âš¡ TL;DR:

- **Never load millions into memory**.
- Use **pagination**, **streaming**, or **batching**.
- In JPA, prefer **Stream** methods or **fetchSize tuning**.
- Optionally use **Spring Batch** if process is complicated.

# ðŸ§  Quick Interview Elevator Pitch (30 sec answer)

> "To fetch huge data efficiently in Java, I design the system using batching or streaming. I fetch small chunks (e.g., 1000 records at a time) either by using pagination (limit/offset) or by streaming the database cursor. I make sure memory is released after each batch and use connection management carefully. In JPA, I use Stream queries; if the processing is complex, I prefer Spring Batch for robust scalable batch processing."
