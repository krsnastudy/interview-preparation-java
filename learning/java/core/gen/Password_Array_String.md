## ✅ Why is Password recommended as a `char[]` instead of `String`?

### 🔐 **Reason: Security Concerns**

Using `char[]` instead of `String` helps reduce the **risk of sensitive data** (like passwords) lingering in memory.

## 🔎 Detailed Explanation

| Aspect                   | `String`                                         | `char[]`                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Immutability**         | Immutable — cannot be changed once created       | Mutable — contents can be modified or cleared |
| **Memory persistence**   | Remains in memory until garbage collected        | Can be explicitly overwritten after use       |
| **Risk**                 | Stays in memory → potential leak via memory dump | Reduced risk — can null out or zero the array |
| **Use in security APIs** | Not recommended                                  | Preferred in `javax.security`, JDBC, etc.     |

## 🧠 Interview Insight:

### ❌ Why is `String` unsafe?

```java
String pwd = "Secret123";
```

* **Stays in memory longer** — the value remains in **String pool** or heap until garbage collected.
* You can't clear its content — since it's immutable.

---

### ✅ Why `char[]` is safer?

```java
char[] pwd = {'S','e','c','r','e','t','1','2','3'};
// Use it for authentication...
Arrays.fill(pwd, '\0'); // Clear it manually
```

* You can **manually wipe the array** right after use.
* Helps in **passing secure credentials** in security-sensitive code.

## 🔐 Real-world Example: JDBC

```java
Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, passwordCharArray);
```

JDBC drivers usually provide overloads that accept `char[]` for passwords.

## ✅ TL;DR

| Why Prefer `char[]` Over `String` for Passwords?       |
| ------------------------------------------------------ |
| ✅ Strings are immutable and can’t be wiped from memory |
| ✅ `char[]` can be modified and cleared after use       |
| ✅ Reduces security risks like memory dump leakage      |
