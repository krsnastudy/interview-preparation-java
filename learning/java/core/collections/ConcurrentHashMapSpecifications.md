This is a **very important topic** for experienced Java interviews. Let’s go deep but crisp 🔥:

---

# ✅ **ConcurrentHashMap Specifications**

---

### 🔹 What is ConcurrentHashMap?

- A **thread-safe** version of `HashMap`.
- Allows **concurrent read and write** operations **without locking the entire map**.
- Designed for **high-concurrency** applications — better performance than using `Collections.synchronizedMap()`.

---

# ⚙️ Internal Working

| Feature | Details |
|:--------|:--------|
| **Thread Safety** | Achieved internally with fine-grained locking (not by locking the whole map). |
| **Concurrency Level** (pre-Java 8) | Internally divides map into **segments** (default: 16) for parallelism. |
| **Java 8 onwards** | **Buckets are individual linked lists / trees**; uses **CAS (Compare-And-Swap)** and **synchronized blocks** for updates. |
| **Reads** | Non-blocking; **no locking** required for reading. |
| **Writes** | Bucket-level locking only (minimal lock granularity). |
| **Null Handling** | **Does not allow null keys or null values.** |
| **Resizing** | Supports dynamic resizing with minimal contention. |
| **Iterator Behavior** | **Weakly consistent**: reflects some, but not necessarily all, changes made during iteration. No `ConcurrentModificationException`. |

# 🚀 Key Points (Interview Specific)

| Aspect | ConcurrentHashMap |
|:-------|:------------------|
| Null keys allowed? | ❌ No |
| Null values allowed? | ❌ No |
| Thread-safety? | ✅ Yes (internally fine-grained locking) |
| Locking mechanism | Segment locking (Java 7), bucket-level locking (Java 8) |
| Performance | Much better than synchronized map |
| Fail-fast Iterator? | ❌ No (it's **weakly consistent**) |
| Load factor default | 0.75 |
| Concurrency level default (Java 7) | 16 segments |
| Usage of CAS | ✅ Used in Java 8 (e.g., for putIfAbsent) |

# 🧠 How locking changed Java 7 vs Java 8?

| Java 7 | Java 8 |
|:-------|:-------|
| Divided into **segments** (mini HashTables). | No Segments. Single array of buckets, but bucket-level locking. |
| Lock applied at **segment level**. | Lock applied at **bucket level** (only for modifying bucket). |
| Slightly more heavyweight. | Much more lightweight and performant. |

# ✨ Example Code

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;

public class ConcurrentHashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConcurrentHashMap<Integer, String> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
        
        map.put(1, "Java");
        map.put(2, "Spring");
        
        System.out.println(map.get(1));
        
        map.forEach((k, v) -> System.out.println(k + " : " + v));
    }
}
```

# 📈 Real World Usage

- Caching systems (thread-safe)
- Session management
- Counting items accessed by multiple threads
- Storing shared configuration in a microservice

---

# ⚡ TL;DR (Interview Style)

> `ConcurrentHashMap` is a **thread-safe**, **high-performance**, **non-blocking** version of `HashMap`.  
> It **disallows null keys and values**, uses **bucket-level locking** or **CAS**, and its iterators are **weakly consistent**.  
> It's **much faster** than a synchronized map for concurrent applications.

Would you also like me to show a **multi-threaded example** (`Thread-1` and `Thread-2` adding values concurrently into `ConcurrentHashMap`)?  
(That's a nice touch to impress interviewers 🚀)
