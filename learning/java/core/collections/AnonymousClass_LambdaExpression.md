**Anonymous Class** and **Lambda Expression** both are ways to implement functional behavior in Java, but they are quite different.

---

### ðŸ‘‰ 1. **Anonymous Class**
- Introduced in Java **1.1**.
- **Full class definition** without naming the class.
- Can **implement interfaces** or **extend classes**.
- Slightly **verbose** (lots of boilerplate).

**Example:**

```java
Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running from Anonymous Class");
    }
};
new Thread(runnable).start();
```

---

### ðŸ‘‰ 2. **Lambda Expression**
- Introduced in Java **8**.
- Only works with **Functional Interfaces** (interface with a single abstract method).
- Provides a **much shorter syntax**.
- Purely **behavioral**, no class creation overhead.

**Example:**

```java
Runnable runnable = () -> {
    System.out.println("Running from Lambda Expression");
};
new Thread(runnable).start();
```

### ðŸ‘‰ Major Differences:

| Feature                        | Anonymous Class                     | Lambda Expression              |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Syntax                         | Verbose                             | Concise (short)                 |
| Object Creation                | Creates a separate class file       | No class file, only behavior passed |
| "this" Keyword                 | Refers to anonymous class itself    | Refers to enclosing class       |
| Type Support                   | Can implement multiple methods (if extending abstract classes) | Only functional interfaces (Single Abstract Method) |
| Access to Variables            | Can access final or effectively final variables | Same (final or effectively final) |
| Performance                    | Slower (more overhead)              | Faster (optimized by JVM)       |

---

### ðŸ‘‰ Quick Note on `this` behavior:
In **Anonymous class**:
```java
Runnable r = new Runnable() {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println(this); // refers to the Anonymous class object
    }
};
```

In **Lambda**:
```java
Runnable r = () -> {
    System.out.println(this); // refers to the enclosing class (NOT lambda)
};
```

---

### âœ… **TL;DR:**

- **Anonymous class** âž” Old, verbose, can extend/implement anything.
- **Lambda expression** âž” New, concise, **only for Functional Interfaces**, better performance.
