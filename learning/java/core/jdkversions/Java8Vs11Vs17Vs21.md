## ðŸ§  How to Present in Interview?

### âœ… When asked: _"Which Java version are you using? Why?"_

**Sample Response**:
> We're currently using **Java 17 (LTS)** for our microservices. It offers better performance and cleaner code, especially with **sealed classes** and **pattern matching**, which improve domain modeling and reduce verbosity.

### âœ… When asked: _"Whatâ€™s new in Java 21?"_

**Key points:**
- **Virtual Threads (Preview)**: Lightweight threads for high-concurrency tasks (great for reactive/non-blocking apps).
- **Record Patterns**: Pattern matching with record types.
- **String Templates (Preview)**: Interpolated strings like in modern languages.
- **Scoped Values (Incubator)**: Better thread-local replacements for structured concurrency.
- **Generational ZGC**: Optimized garbage collection for young/old objects.

## âœ… Java Feature Evolution (Sample Highlights)

### ðŸ”¹ Java 8 (Base for FP)
- Lambdas & Functional Interfaces
- Streams API
- `Optional<T>` â€“ Null safety
- New Date-Time API

### ðŸ”¹ Java 11
- `var` for local variables
- HttpClient API (for REST calls)
- String utility methods like `isBlank()`, `lines()`, `repeat()`
- Removed JavaFX, WebStart

### ðŸ”¹ Java 17
- **Sealed Classes**: Better class hierarchy control
- **Pattern Matching**: Clean instanceof checks
- **Switch Expressions**
- **Text Blocks**: Write multiline strings
- **Strong encapsulation of JDK internals**

### ðŸ”¹ Java 21
- **Virtual Threads**: Lightweight, scalable threads
- **Scoped Values**: Enhanced thread-local usage
- **Structured Concurrency**: Manage child threads as a unit
- **Record Patterns**, **String Templates**

## ðŸ§© Real-time Scenario

> In my current project, we migrated from **Java 8 to Java 17**, which improved performance (due to G1GC optimizations), and we made use of **sealed classes** for secure modeling of event types. For newer services focused on high concurrency, we are exploring **Java 21 virtual threads** to reduce thread-pool overhead in I/O-heavy components.

---

## âœ… TL;DR

- **Use Java 17** for stability and modern syntax.
- **Explore Java 21** for concurrent apps and future readiness.
- **Java 8 â†’ 17 jump** adds performance + modern coding practices.
- Focus on **LTS versions** in production unless experimenting.
