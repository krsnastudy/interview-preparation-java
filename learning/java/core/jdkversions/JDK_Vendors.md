| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ownership**        | Open source, maintained by the community                  | Developed and maintained by Oracle                                                              |
| **License**          | GNU General Public License (GPL v2 + Classpath Exception) | Oracle No-Fee Terms and Conditions (NFTC)                                                       |
| **Source Code**      | Completely open source                                    | Based on OpenJDK, includes some commercial tools                                                |
| **Cost**             | Free                                                      | Free for most use cases since Java 17; earlier versions required a license                      |

## ‚úÖ Historical Context

* **Before Java 11**: Oracle JDK had **some proprietary features** not in OpenJDK.
* **Since Java 11+**: Oracle JDK and OpenJDK are **almost identical in features and performance**.
* **Since Java 17+**: Oracle JDK is free for most production use under the **NFTC license**.

---

## üîç Which One Should You Use?

### üî∏ Use **OpenJDK**:

* If you need **open-source & free distribution**
* For **cloud-native apps**, **containers**, **DevOps pipelines**
* If using builds from vendors like **Eclipse Temurin (Adoptium)**, **Amazon Corretto**, **Red Hat**, etc.

### üî∏ Use **Oracle JDK**:

* If your **organization has Oracle support contracts**
* If you need **long-term support (LTS)** from Oracle
* For **enterprise apps** that rely on Oracle-specific tools
