**Functional Programming** is a programming paradigm where **computation is treated as the evaluation of mathematical functions** and **avoids changing state and mutable data**.

### ✅ Key Concepts in Functional Programming:

| Concept                      | Description                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pure Functions**           | Function output depends only on input and has no side effects.          |
| **Immutability**             | Data does not change once created.                                      |
| **First-Class Functions**    | Functions are treated as values (can be passed/stored).                 |
| **Higher-Order Functions**   | Functions that take other functions as parameters or return them.       |
| **Declarative Style**        | Focus on **what** to do, not **how** to do it.                          |
| **Referential Transparency** | An expression can be replaced with its value without changing behavior. |

### ✅ Java 8 and Functional Programming

Java introduced functional features in **Java 8**:

* **Lambda Expressions**: `(a, b) -> a + b`
* **Functional Interfaces**: `Function<T, R>`, `Predicate<T>`, etc.
* **Streams API**: For declarative data processing
* **Optional Class**: To handle nulls functionally

### ✅ Interview Short Answer:

> Functional Programming is a style where functions are first-class citizens, state is immutable, and logic is expressed declaratively. Java 8 supports this via lambdas, functional interfaces, and Streams.
