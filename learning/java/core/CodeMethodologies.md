When you’re asked **"How do you code methodologies?"** in an interview, they’re essentially asking:

> “What development practices, principles, or methodologies do you follow when writing code in a professional project?”

Here’s how you should answer — structured and from an **experienced Java developer's perspective**:

---

### ✅ **1. Follow SOLID Principles (OOP Design)**
I design my Java classes using **SOLID principles**:
- **S**: Single Responsibility – each class handles one concern.
- **O**: Open/Closed – open for extension, closed for modification.
- **L**: Liskov Substitution – subclass can replace parent class without issues.
- **I**: Interface Segregation – use multiple small interfaces instead of one big one.
- **D**: Dependency Inversion – depend on abstractions, not implementations.

```java
// Example: Using interface instead of hard dependency
public interface NotificationService {
    void send(String message);
}
```

---

### ✅ **2. Layered Architecture (N-tier)**

I follow **clean separation of concerns**:
- **Controller Layer** – handles HTTP requests
- **Service Layer** – business logic
- **DAO/Repository Layer** – database interaction
- **Model/Entity Layer** – data representation

---

### ✅ **3. Use of Design Patterns**

I apply relevant **design patterns** when needed:
- Singleton (Spring Beans)
- Factory (Object creation)
- Strategy (Plug different behaviors)
- Observer (Event handling)
- Builder (Complex object creation)

```java
// Strategy pattern example for payment
public interface PaymentStrategy { void pay(); }
```

---

### ✅ **4. Clean Code Practices**

- Meaningful method and variable names
- Avoid deep nesting
- Favor immutability where applicable
- Small, reusable methods
- Write code that is **self-documenting**

---

### ✅ **5. Test-Driven Development (TDD)**

- I write **unit tests** using JUnit/Mockito
- Write test cases **before or along with code**
- Focus on **code coverage**, edge cases, and clean test naming

---

### ✅ **6. Code Reviews & Static Code Analysis**

- Participate in code reviews actively
- Use tools like **SonarQube**, **Checkstyle**, **PMD**
- Fix code smells, reduce cyclomatic complexity

---

### ✅ **7. Follow Git Branching Strategy**

- Feature branch ➝ develop ➝ main
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Rebase before PR merge

---

### ✅ **8. CI/CD Ready Code**

- Ensure code is **testable, modular, and buildable**
- Integrate with pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)
- Use Maven or Gradle for structured builds

---

### ✅ **9. Documentation**

- Use **Javadoc**
- Swagger/OpenAPI for REST APIs
- README.md for module usage

---

### ✅ **10. Agile Friendly**

- Break tasks into stories
- Write code in small deliverable chunks
- Participate in sprint planning, retrospectives

---

### 📢 **TL;DR:**

> *"I follow clean code, SOLID principles, layered architecture, design patterns, and TDD. I ensure my code is scalable, testable, and CI/CD ready with best practices in version control, documentation, and Agile delivery."*

### ✅ **How I Follow Coding Methodologies (Interview Template Answer)**

> As an experienced Java developer, I follow industry-standard coding methodologies that ensure scalability, maintainability, and testability of the codebase. My approach includes:

1. **SOLID Principles** – I ensure clean OOP design by adhering to Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, and other SOLID rules.
2. **Layered Architecture** – I separate concerns using Controller, Service, Repository, and Model layers for better modularity.
3. **Design Patterns** – I apply patterns like Singleton, Factory, Strategy, and Builder wherever applicable to solve recurring problems efficiently.
4. **Clean Code Practices** – I write readable, well-named, and modular code, and avoid deep nesting or duplication.
5. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** – I write unit tests using JUnit/Mockito alongside the code to validate functionality and edge cases.
6. **Code Reviews & Static Analysis** – I actively participate in code reviews and use tools like SonarQube, Checkstyle to maintain code quality.
7. **Version Control (Git)** – I follow Git best practices with feature branching, rebasing, and clear commit messages.
8. **CI/CD Readiness** – I ensure my code integrates cleanly into build pipelines using Maven or Gradle and supports automated deployments.
9. **Documentation** – I maintain code-level documentation using Javadoc and use Swagger/OpenAPI for REST APIs.
10. **Agile & DevOps Alignment** – I follow Agile principles, collaborate in sprint ceremonies, and deliver small, working increments regularly.
