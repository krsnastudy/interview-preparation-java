## 🧠 What are Virtual Threads?

**Virtual Threads** are lightweight threads **managed by the Java runtime**, not by the OS. They allow you to write **highly concurrent** applications with **millions of threads** — without the memory and context-switching costs of traditional platform threads.

### ✅ Think of it as:
- Traditional thread → 🧍 Person using a hotel room
- Virtual thread → 🧍Person using a **capsule in a capsule hotel** – much cheaper, lightweight, and scalable.

## 🚀 Traditional vs Virtual Threads

| Feature                | Platform Thread (Classic) | Virtual Thread (New)        |
|------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Backed by              | OS thread                  | Java runtime-managed      |
| Memory per thread      | ~1MB                       | ~1KB                        |
| Context switching      | Done by OS                 | Done by JVM (cheap)         |
| Blocking IO            | Blocks the OS thread       | Only blocks the virtual thread |
| Number of threads      | ~thousands                 | **Millions**                |
| Introduced in          | Since forever              | ✅ Stable in JDK 21          |

## 🔧 How to Create Virtual Threads?

### ✅ JDK 21 Code:

```java
Runnable task = () -> {
    System.out.println("Running in thread: " + Thread.currentThread());
};

Thread vt = Thread.ofVirtual().start(task);
vt.join();
```

### Using an Executor:

```java
try (ExecutorService executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
    executor.submit(() -> {
        System.out.println("Hello from virtual thread: " + Thread.currentThread());
    });
}
```

## ✨ Benefits of Virtual Threads

1. ✅ **Massive concurrency** – Millions of threads with little overhead.
2. ✅ **Simplifies asynchronous code** – No need for callbacks or reactive frameworks.
3. ✅ **Better scalability** – Great for I/O-heavy workloads like web servers.
4. ✅ **Easy migration** – Replace existing threads with virtual ones with minimal code change.

## 🔍 Real-World Example

Imagine a web server handling 1M HTTP requests concurrently. Using classic threads would OOM (OutOfMemory) quickly.  
With virtual threads, each request handler can be its own thread — cheap, isolated, and managed by JVM.

---

## ⚠️ Caveats

- Virtual threads are **not a silver bullet**. They don't make CPU-bound tasks faster.
- Don't use thread-local data blindly (because virtual threads are reused).
- Libraries doing native calls or blocking OS threads still need care.

## 🧠 TL;DR

- Java Virtual Threads = ultra-lightweight threads introduced in JDK 21
- Allow writing scalable, concurrent apps with millions of threads
- Perfect for I/O-bound tasks, async workflows, microservices
- `Thread.ofVirtual().start()` or use `Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()`

Awesome! Let's build a simple **performance comparison demo** between:

1. **Platform Threads** (traditional)
2. **Virtual Threads** (JDK 21+)

---

## ✅ Goal:

We’ll spawn **10,000 threads**, each simulating a lightweight I/O task (like sleeping for 1 second).  
We’ll **measure the time taken** for both types.

## ⚙️ Code: Platform vs Virtual Threads (Java 21+)

```java
import java.time.Duration;
import java.time.Instant;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class ThreadComparisonDemo {

    static final int TASK_COUNT = 10_000;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        System.out.println("Starting comparison...");

        runWithPlatformThreads(); // Legacy
        runWithVirtualThreads();  // New and awesome
    }

    // 🔹 Platform Threads
    private static void runWithPlatformThreads() throws InterruptedException {
        Instant start = Instant.now();

        Thread[] threads = new Thread[TASK_COUNT];
        for (int i = 0; i < TASK_COUNT; i++) {
            threads[i] = new Thread(() -> sleepOneSecond());
            threads[i].start();
        }
        for (Thread t : threads) {
            t.join();
        }

        Instant end = Instant.now();
        System.out.println("Platform Threads Took: " + Duration.between(start, end).toMillis() + " ms");
    }

    // 🔹 Virtual Threads (JDK 21+)
    private static void runWithVirtualThreads() throws InterruptedException {
        Instant start = Instant.now();

        try (ExecutorService executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
            IntStream.range(0, TASK_COUNT)
                    .forEach(i -> executor.submit(ThreadComparisonDemo::sleepOneSecond));
        }

        Instant end = Instant.now();
        System.out.println("Virtual Threads Took: " + Duration.between(start, end).toMillis() + " ms");
    }

    private static void sleepOneSecond() {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000); // simulate blocking I/O
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}
```

---

## 🧪 What to Expect?

- **Platform Threads**: Likely **runs out of memory** or takes a long time (~seconds to minutes depending on hardware).
- **Virtual Threads**: Handles 10k+ with ease and completes in ~1 second.
