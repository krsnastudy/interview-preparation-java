In **JDK 1.5 (Java 5)**, a significant update was introduced to enhance **concurrency** support, primarily through the **`java.util.concurrent`** package. This package includes several classes, interfaces, and utilities designed to simplify concurrent programming and improve performance in multi-threaded applications.

Here’s an overview of the **main concurrency classes** introduced in **JDK 1.5**:

---

### 1. **Executors and Executor Framework**

- **`Executor`**: A simple interface for executing tasks asynchronously. It abstracts the details of how threads are created and managed.
- **`ExecutorService`**: Extends `Executor` to provide additional methods for lifecycle management, such as `submit()`, `invokeAll()`, and `shutdown()`.
- **`ThreadPoolExecutor`**: A concrete implementation of `ExecutorService` that executes tasks using a pool of worker threads. It provides fine-grained control over thread management, including core pool size, maximum pool size, and queue size.
- **`ScheduledExecutorService`**: Extends `ExecutorService` to support scheduling of tasks with fixed-rate or fixed-delay execution policies.

### 2. **Concurrent Collections**

- **`CopyOnWriteArrayList`**: A thread-safe variant of `ArrayList` that provides efficient **iteration** at the cost of slower updates.
- **`CopyOnWriteArraySet`**: A thread-safe variant of `HashSet` that uses a copy-on-write strategy for modifications.
- **`ConcurrentHashMap`**: A highly concurrent **hash map** designed for multi-threaded environments. It allows concurrent reads and writes, dividing the map into segments to reduce contention.
- **`BlockingQueue`**: An interface for thread-safe queues that support blocking operations. Implementations include:
    - **`ArrayBlockingQueue`**: A bounded blocking queue backed by an array.
    - **`LinkedBlockingQueue`**: A blocking queue backed by a linked node structure (supports both bounded and unbounded versions).
    - **`PriorityBlockingQueue`**: A blocking queue that supports priority ordering of elements.
    - **`DelayQueue`**: A blocking queue where elements can only be taken when their delay has expired.
    - **`SynchronousQueue`**: A special kind of blocking queue where every insert operation must wait for a corresponding take operation.

### 3. **Locks and Synchronizers**

- **`ReentrantLock`**: A more flexible and feature-rich replacement for synchronized blocks and methods. It supports locking with advanced features like **try-lock**, **timed lock**, and **interruptible lock acquisition**.
- **`ReentrantReadWriteLock`**: A lock that allows multiple readers to access a resource concurrently while ensuring exclusive access for writers.
- **`StampedLock`**: A more lightweight version of `ReentrantReadWriteLock`, offering better performance in some cases for certain use-cases (e.g., non-blocking reads).
- **`CountDownLatch`**: A synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations being performed in other threads completes.
- **`CyclicBarrier`**: A synchronization aid that allows a set of threads to wait for each other to reach a common barrier point before proceeding.
- **`Semaphore`**: A counting semaphore used to control access to a particular resource by multiple threads.
- **`Exchanger`**: A synchronization point at which threads can pair and swap elements within those pairs.

### 4. **Atomic Variables**

- **`AtomicInteger`**: An integer value that can be updated atomically (without synchronization) using methods like `incrementAndGet()`, `decrementAndGet()`, and `compareAndSet()`.
- **`AtomicLong`**: Similar to `AtomicInteger` but for `long` values.
- **`AtomicBoolean`**: A boolean value that can be updated atomically.
- **`AtomicReference`**: A reference to an object that can be updated atomically.
- **`AtomicMarkableReference`**: Similar to `AtomicReference`, but with an additional **mark** flag that can be used to track state changes atomically.

### 5. **Future and Callable**

- **`Callable`**: Similar to `Runnable`, but can return a result or throw an exception. It’s often used with an `ExecutorService`.
- **`Future`**: Represents the result of an asynchronous computation. It provides methods like `get()`, `cancel()`, and `isDone()` to manage and retrieve the result of a task.
- **`ForkJoinTask`**: An abstract class representing tasks that can be used in the **Fork/Join Framework** for parallel tasks.

### 6. **Fork/Join Framework**

- **`ForkJoinPool`**: A special kind of `ExecutorService` designed for efficiently executing a large number of small tasks, often with a **divide-and-conquer** approach.
- **`RecursiveTask<V>`**: A subclass of `ForkJoinTask` that represents tasks that return a result.
- **`RecursiveAction`**: A subclass of `ForkJoinTask` that represents tasks that do not return a result.

### 7. **Other Utilities**

- **`ThreadLocalRandom`**: A random number generator designed for use in concurrent environments. Unlike `Random`, which is not thread-safe, `ThreadLocalRandom` provides a way to generate random numbers without contention.
- **`TimeUnit`**: An enum that provides utility methods to convert between time units (e.g., seconds to milliseconds).
- **`AtomicIntegerArray`**, **`AtomicLongArray`**, **`AtomicReferenceArray`**: These are atomic versions of the arrays that allow atomic updates to array elements.

### TL;DR:
In **JDK 1.5**, the **`java.util.concurrent`** package introduced several classes and interfaces to support concurrent programming, including:

- **Executors & Executor Framework** (`Executor`, `ExecutorService`, `ThreadPoolExecutor`, `ScheduledExecutorService`).
- **Concurrent Collections** (`ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, `BlockingQueue`).
- **Locks & Synchronizers** (`ReentrantLock`, `CountDownLatch`, `CyclicBarrier`, `Semaphore`).
- **Atomic Variables** (`AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong`, `AtomicReference`).
- **Future & Callable** (`Callable`, `Future`).
- **Fork/Join Framework** (`ForkJoinPool`, `RecursiveTask`).
- **Other utilities** (`ThreadLocalRandom`, `TimeUnit`).
