The terms **Agile** and **Scrum** are often used interchangeably, but they refer to **different concepts** in software development. Here's a clear breakdown from an **interview perspective**:

### ✅ **Agile vs Scrum - Key Differences**

| Feature             | **Agile**                                                    | **Scrum**                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**      | A **set of principles** for iterative development            | A **framework** that implements Agile principles      |
| **Type**            | **Mindset/Philosophy**                                       | **Methodology/Process Framework**                     |
| **Origin**          | Defined in the **Agile Manifesto (2001)**                    | Developed by **Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland**     |
| **Flexibility**     | Broad and flexible                                           | Prescriptive, with defined roles/events/artifacts     |
| **Process**         | Varies based on the implementation (Scrum, Kanban, XP, etc.) | Follows defined process: sprints, stand-ups, reviews  |
| **Roles**           | No specific roles mandated                                   | Specific roles: **Product Owner, Scrum Master, Team** |
| **Deliverables**    | Continuously delivers working software                       | Delivers at the end of each **Sprint (2–4 weeks)**    |
| **Documentation**   | Lightweight, just enough                                     | Scrum doesn’t mandate but allows flexibility          |
| **Change Handling** | Welcomes changes anytime                                     | Changes allowed between sprints, not during           |
| **Best Suited For** | Projects requiring **continuous feedback** and flexibility   | Teams that can work in **defined iterations**         |

### 🔍 Example for Clarity

* **Agile** is like a **diet philosophy** that says "eat healthy, eat in moderation, avoid junk food."
* **Scrum** is like a **specific meal plan** (e.g., Keto or Paleo) that tells you what to eat, when, and in what portion.

### 📌 Interview Tip:

> If asked "Are Agile and Scrum the same?", answer:
>
> ❝ No. Agile is a broader set of values and principles for software development. Scrum is a concrete methodology that follows Agile principles. ❞

---

### TL;DR:

* **Agile** = Philosophy / Mindset
* **Scrum** = Agile Framework with roles & ceremonies (Sprints, Reviews, etc.)
* **Agile has many frameworks**, Scrum is just one of them.

Here's how you can **confidently explain the difference between Agile and Scrum** in an **interview setting**, with crisp, structured, and relevant points that interviewers look for:

---

### ✅ Interview Answer – *“What is the difference between Agile and Scrum?”*

> **"Agile** is a **software development philosophy** or mindset defined by the **Agile Manifesto**. It emphasizes iterative development, customer collaboration, and responsiveness to change.
>
> **Scrum**, on the other hand, is a **specific framework** that implements Agile principles. It provides a structured way of working using well-defined roles like **Product Owner**, **Scrum Master**, and **Development Team**, and fixed-length iterations called **Sprints** (usually 2-4 weeks).
>
> So, in short:
>
> * Agile is **what** you want to achieve (iterative, value-driven delivery).
> * Scrum is **how** you do it (by organizing work into sprints with defined ceremonies).
>
> Also, Agile has several frameworks under it – like **Scrum, Kanban, XP**, and **SAFe** – and Scrum is just one of the most popular ones."\*

### ✅ Example to Strengthen the Answer

> *“For example, in my current project, we follow the Agile methodology using the Scrum framework. Every 2 weeks, we have Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, Sprint Review, and Retrospective. These help us deliver features iteratively while incorporating client feedback quickly.”*

### 🎯 Key Pointers to Include:

| Aspect        | Agile                 | Scrum                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Concept       | Methodology / Mindset | Framework to implement Agile            |
| Documentation | Lightweight           | Defined artifacts (e.g. Sprint Backlog) |
| Roles         | Not defined           | Scrum Master, Product Owner, Team       |
| Iteration     | Continuous delivery   | Sprint-based (2–4 weeks)                |

---

### 🧠 Bonus – If Asked: "Which do you prefer and why?"

> *“I prefer using Scrum when working with cross-functional teams that require clarity, accountability, and structured delivery. It enforces discipline through ceremonies and roles while still allowing us to be Agile.”*

---

### ✅ TL;DR for Interview:

* Agile is **philosophy** → Scrum is **a way to apply it**.
* Agile is **broad**, Scrum is **specific**.
* Mention your real project experience with Scrum if possible.
