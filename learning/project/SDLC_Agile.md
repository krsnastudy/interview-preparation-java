Yes, **SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)** absolutely fits into the **Agile framework**, but with adaptations.

### âœ… Quick Interview Answer:

> Yes, SDLC fits into Agile. Agile follows all SDLC phases (requirements, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance) but does so iteratively in short cycles called sprints.

### ðŸ§© Detailed Explanation:

**Traditional SDLC Phases:**

1. Requirements Gathering
2. Design
3. Development
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

**Agile SDLC Mapping:**

| SDLC Phase   | Agile Adaptation                                                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Requirements | Gathered incrementally before each sprint (user stories, backlog grooming)     |
| Design       | Lightweight, just enough for each sprint; evolves iteratively                  |
| Development  | Done in sprints (2â€“4 weeks), working features built iteratively                |
| Testing      | Integrated in each sprint (automated/unit/integration testingâ€”Test-Driven Dev) |
| Deployment   | Continuous delivery/deployment possible via DevOps pipelines                   |
| Maintenance  | Bugs/enhancements addressed in future sprints                                  |

### ðŸ’¡ Key Points:

* Agile is **not a replacement** for SDLC, it is a **way of executing** SDLC phases.
* Agile improves **feedback loop**, **risk management**, and **time-to-market**.
* Tools like **Jira**, **Scrum boards**, and **CI/CD** help manage Agile SDLC.
