## ✅ What is Azure DevOps?

**Azure DevOps** is a cloud-based platform by Microsoft that provides a complete **DevOps lifecycle management solution**, including:

- **Code Repositories (Repos)**
- **Build & Release Pipelines (Pipelines)**
- **Work Item Tracking (Boards)**
- **Artifact Management (Artifacts)**
- **Test Management (Test Plans)**

---

## 🔧 Core Components (Explain These in Interviews)

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Azure Repos** | Git repositories for source control (like GitHub/Bitbucket) |
| **Azure Pipelines** | CI/CD pipelines for building, testing, and deploying code |
| **Azure Boards** | Agile work item tracking (Epics, Stories, Tasks, Bugs) |
| **Azure Artifacts** | Hosting NuGet, Maven, npm, Python packages |
| **Azure Test Plans** | Manual and exploratory testing tools |

---

## 🧪 Interview-Oriented Real-Time Scenario (Java Dev)

> “In our project, we used **Azure Pipelines** to implement CI/CD for our Spring Boot microservices. Every code push triggers a **build pipeline** which compiles the code, runs JUnit/Mockito tests, performs static analysis using **SonarQube**, and creates a Docker image. That image is pushed to Azure Container Registry and deployed to **Kubernetes on Azure (AKS)** via the **release pipeline**.”

---

## 🚀 Azure DevOps Pipeline YAML – Spring Boot CI Example

```yaml
trigger:
  - main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

variables:
  imageName: 'my-springboot-app'

steps:
  - task: Maven@3
    inputs:
      mavenPomFile: 'pom.xml'
      goals: 'clean package'
      options: '-DskipTests'

  - task: Docker@2
    inputs:
      containerRegistry: 'myACRConnection'
      repository: 'myrepo/$(imageName)'
      command: 'buildAndPush'
      Dockerfile: '**/Dockerfile'
```

## 🛡️ DevOps Best Practices to Mention

| Area | Best Practice |
|------|---------------|
| **CI/CD** | Build, Test, and Deploy automatically using pipelines |
| **Security** | Integrate **Checkmarx** or **SonarQube** for code analysis |
| **Secrets** | Use **Azure Key Vault** for credentials |
| **Branch Strategy** | Use GitFlow or Trunk-based development |
| **Rollback** | Use pipeline stages and approval gates for safe deploys |

---

## 🎯 Interview Talking Points

- “We use Azure DevOps to manage **end-to-end delivery** from code commit to deployment.”
- “Our pipelines are defined in **YAML** for version control and transparency.”
- “Builds trigger **automated tests** and **quality gates** before moving to QA or Prod.”
- “We use **Environments** and **Manual Approvals** for staged releases.”
- “Artifacts are stored in **Azure Artifacts** and reused across services.”

## ✅ TL;DR for Interview:

| Topic | What to Say |
|------|-------------|
| CI/CD | Azure Pipelines for automated build/test/deploy |
| Version Control | Azure Repos (Git-based) |
| Secrets | Managed using Azure Key Vault |
| Deployment | Docker to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) |
| Reporting | Pipelines integrated with Boards for traceability |
| Testing | Unit test reports, SonarQube integration |

## ✅ **Azure DevOps – Release Pipeline Example**
### 🔹 Use Case:
Deploy a **Spring Boot Microservice Docker image** from Azure Container Registry (ACR) to **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** with **approval gates** and stages.

---

### 🧱 Release Pipeline Stages:
1. **Dev**
2. **QA** (Manual approval required)
3. **Production** (Approval + rollback enabled)

---

### 📄 Sample Pipeline Structure

```yaml
stages:
- stage: Dev
  jobs:
  - job: DeployToDev
    pool:
      vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
      - script: echo "Deploying to DEV namespace"
      - task: Kubernetes@1
        inputs:
          connectionType: 'Azure Resource Manager'
          azureSubscription: 'your-subscription'
          azureResourceGroup: 'my-k8s-rg'
          kubernetesCluster: 'my-aks-cluster'
          namespace: 'dev'
          command: apply
          useConfigurationFile: true
          configuration: 'manifests/deployment.yaml'

- stage: QA
  dependsOn: Dev
  condition: succeeded()
  approval:
    - name: 'QA Lead Approval'
  jobs:
  - job: DeployToQA
    pool:
      vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
      - script: echo "Deploying to QA namespace"
      - task: Kubernetes@1
        inputs:
          namespace: 'qa'
          configuration: 'manifests/deployment.yaml'

- stage: Prod
  dependsOn: QA
  condition: succeeded()
  approval:
    - name: 'Release Manager Approval'
  jobs:
  - job: DeployToProd
    pool:
      vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
      - script: echo "Deploying to Production"
      - task: Kubernetes@1
        inputs:
          namespace: 'prod'
          configuration: 'manifests/deployment.yaml'
```

## ✅ Talking Points for Interview

### 🔹 1. **Stages with Gates**
> "We break down release pipelines into **Dev → QA → Prod** stages. We use **pre-deployment approvals** in QA and Prod to ensure safe transitions, aligned with change control."

### 🔹 2. **Rollback & History**
> "Azure DevOps provides release history, so we can **revert to a previous release** quickly using built-in rollback or by redeploying a specific artifact version."

### 🔹 3. **Secure Deployment**
> "We integrate with **Azure Key Vault** to fetch secrets, DB credentials, and API keys during runtime deployment."

### 🔹 4. **Promotions**
> "Artifacts are **built once and promoted across stages**, ensuring consistency between environments."
