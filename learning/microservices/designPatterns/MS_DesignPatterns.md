Microservices rely on various design patterns to **ensure resilience, scalability, maintainability, and communication efficiency**. Here's a categorized and detailed breakdown of **common Microservices Design Patterns**, perfect for **interview prep** and real-world use.

---

## üß± 1. **Decomposition Patterns** (Splitting a Monolith)

### 1.1. **Decompose by Business Capability**

* **What**: Split services based on business domains (e.g., PaymentService, InventoryService).
* **Why**: Aligns with DDD (Domain-Driven Design); improves modularity.
* **Interview Tip**: Helps teams work independently.

### 1.2. **Decompose by Subdomain**

* **What**: Break down by bounded contexts (Core, Supporting, Generic).
* **Why**: Maintains clear ownership and boundaries.

---

## üîÑ 2. **Integration Patterns** (Service Communication)

### 2.1. **API Gateway Pattern**

* **What**: A single entry point for all client requests.
* **Why**: Handles routing, auth, rate-limiting, and load balancing.
* **Tools**: Spring Cloud Gateway, Kong, Zuul.

### 2.2. **Backend for Frontend (BFF)**

* **What**: Create separate backends tailored to different frontend types (web/mobile).
* **Why**: Reduces over-fetching/under-fetching.

### 2.3. **Aggregator Pattern**

* **What**: One service aggregates responses from multiple microservices.
* **Why**: Simplifies client consumption.

### 2.4. **Chained or Orchestration Pattern**

* **What**: Services call each other in a sequence to fulfill a request.
* **Why**: Central control over process flow (orchestration) vs. service-led (choreography).

## üß© 3. **Database Patterns**

### 3.1. **Database per Service**

* **What**: Each service has its own DB.
* **Why**: Enforces loose coupling and autonomy.

### 3.2. **Shared Database**

* **What**: Multiple services share a DB.
* **Why**: Avoid if possible ‚Äî creates tight coupling.

### 3.3. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**

* **What**: Separate read and write models.
* **Why**: Improves performance, scalability.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è 4. **Resilience Patterns**

### 4.1. **Circuit Breaker**

* **What**: Stop calling a failing service temporarily.
* **Tool**: Resilience4j, Hystrix (deprecated).

### 4.2. **Retry**

* **What**: Automatically retry failed calls.
* **Why**: Useful for transient faults.

### 4.3. **Timeout**

* **What**: Fail fast after a timeout threshold.
* **Why**: Prevents long waits.

### 4.4. **Bulkhead** (explained earlier)

* **What**: Isolate resources to prevent cascade failure.

### 4.5. **Rate Limiting / Throttling**

* **What**: Limit requests per client or service.
* **Why**: Prevent overload or abuse.

---

## üì¶ 5. **Observability & Operational Patterns**

### 5.1. **Log Aggregation**

* Use ELK stack or similar for centralized logs.

### 5.2. **Distributed Tracing**

* Tools: OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Zipkin.

### 5.3. **Health Check Pattern**

* Expose `/health` endpoints.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 6. **Cross-Cutting Patterns**

### 6.1. **Service Discovery**

* Register and discover services dynamically.
* Tools: Eureka, Consul.

### 6.2. **Sidecar Pattern**

* Deploy helper services alongside main services (e.g., logging, proxy).
* Tool: Istio, Envoy.

### 6.3. **Strangler Fig Pattern**

* Gradually replace parts of a monolith with microservices.
