### üöó What is the **Chassis Design Pattern** in Microservices?

The **Chassis pattern** is an **infrastructure abstraction pattern** used in microservice architectures. It provides a **common foundation (chassis)** that encapsulates reusable capabilities like:

* Logging
* Metrics
* Security
* Configuration
* Health checks
* Tracing
* Resilience (circuit breakers, retries)

Each microservice is then built **on top of this chassis**, promoting **consistency**, **code reuse**, and **faster development**.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Why Use Chassis Pattern?

Without a chassis:

* Every microservice manually implements logging, metrics, config, etc.
* Inconsistent behaviors and duplication arise.

With a chassis:

* Common infrastructure concerns are **standardized** and **pluggable**.
* Developers focus only on **business logic**.

## üß© Components Typically in a Chassis

| Component                | Responsibility                                             |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Logging Module**       | Centralized log formatting and forwarding                  |
| **Security Module**      | JWT parsing, OAuth2, RBAC enforcement                      |
| **Observability Module** | Micrometer, Prometheus metrics, tracing via Sleuth/Zipkin  |
| **Configuration Loader** | Loads configs from Config Server or local YAML             |
| **Error Handling**       | Global exception handling and response formatting          |
| **Health Checks**        | Liveness and readiness probes                              |
| **Resilience Layer**     | Circuit breaker, timeout, retries via Resilience4j/Hystrix |

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Implement It in Java/Spring Boot

You can build a **Spring Boot Starter** or **shared library** as your chassis:

### 1. Create a `spring-boot-starter-chassis` module:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.yourorg</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-chassis</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

This module contains:

* Common `@ControllerAdvice`
* Logging configs (e.g., Logback)
* Auto-configured interceptors (tracing, metrics)
* Spring Security config
* Base exception classes

### 2. Each microservice depends on it:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.yourorg</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-chassis</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

## üß™ Real-World Analogy

> Think of the chassis in a car ‚Äì it provides the core mechanical structure. Wheels, engine, seats are added to build different cars. Similarly, your microservice-specific logic sits on top of this common infrastructure chassis.

---

## üîç Interview Points

* Promotes **Separation of Concerns**: Infra vs business logic.
* Improves **developer velocity**.
* Reduces **boilerplate** across services.
* Enables **uniform behavior** across services (logging, tracing, auth).
* Supports **easier onboarding** for new developers.

| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Sidecar Pattern             | Runs shared infra **beside** the service, not within  |
| Microservice Template       | Similar, but more code scaffold than runtime infra    |
| Spring Boot Starter Modules | Java-specific way to modularize chassis functionality |
