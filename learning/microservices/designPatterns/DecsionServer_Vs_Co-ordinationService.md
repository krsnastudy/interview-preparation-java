Let‚Äôs clarify and implement what you're asking based on typical **microservice patterns** involving:

### ‚úÖ 1. **Code Decision Server**

This is often referred to as a **"Decision Service"**, where business rules are executed centrally (e.g., using Drools or a custom rules engine).

### ‚úÖ 2. **Coordination Service**

This handles **orchestration** or **workflow coordination** across services (e.g., using a saga pattern or orchestrator like Camunda, Netflix Conductor, or Spring Orchestration using events or commands).

## üìå 1. Code Decision Server Example (Spring Boot + Drools)

### üõ† Technologies

* Spring Boot
* Drools (Rule Engine)
* REST Controller

### üîÅ Business Scenario

If a customer‚Äôs purchase is over ‚Çπ5000, apply 10% discount.

#### üîÑ Rule File (`discount.drl`)

```java
package com.rules;

import com.test.model.Purchase;

rule "Apply 10% discount for high value"
    when
        p : Purchase(amount > 5000)
    then
        p.setDiscount(0.10);
end
```

#### üîß Java Model

```java
@Data
public class Purchase {
    private double amount;
    private double discount;
}
```

#### üéØ Service to Fire Rule

```java
@Service
public class DecisionService {
    @Autowired
    private KieContainer kieContainer;

    public Purchase applyDiscount(Purchase purchase) {
        KieSession session = kieContainer.newKieSession();
        session.insert(purchase);
        session.fireAllRules();
        session.dispose();
        return purchase;
    }
}
```

## üìå 2. Coordination Service Example (Spring Boot Saga Orchestration)

### üõ† Technologies

* Spring Boot
* Spring Events (for basic saga-style coordination)

#### üîÅ Use Case

OrderService -> PaymentService -> NotificationService (coordinated via events)

#### ‚úÖ Order Created ‚Üí Publish Event

```java
@Component
public class OrderService {
    @Autowired
    private ApplicationEventPublisher publisher;

    public void createOrder(Order order) {
        // Save order logic
        publisher.publishEvent(new OrderCreatedEvent(order));
    }
}
```

#### üîÅ Payment Listener

```java
@Component
public class PaymentListener {
    @EventListener
    public void handleOrderCreated(OrderCreatedEvent event) {
        // Process payment
        // then notify
    }
}
```

> You can extend this pattern for full Saga with compensation.

## üîÅ How They Work Together

| Component                | Role                                                     |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Decision Server**      | Encapsulates business rules (decouples from services)    |
| **Coordination Service** | Ensures workflow steps occur in sequence or saga pattern |

## üß† Interview Tips

| Question                                    | Sample Answer                                                                             |

| What is a decision service?                 | A microservice that encapsulates business logic or rules separate from application logic. |
| What is a coordination service?             | A service responsible for managing and orchestrating calls across microservices.          |
| Why decouple logic into a decision server?  | Promotes reusability, centralized rule changes, and clean separation of concerns.         |
| How do you handle distributed coordination? | Via saga pattern, orchestrator tools, or Spring Events.                                   |

## ‚úÖ TL;DR

* **Decision Server**: Central service for rules (e.g., Drools)
* **Coordination Service**: Manages workflows across services (orchestrator or Spring events)
* Combine both in microservices for **separation of concerns and better control**
