## üå≥ What is the Strangler Design Pattern?

> A pattern where you **gradually replace** parts of a legacy system with a new system **piece by piece**, until the old system is fully replaced ‚Äî just like a **strangler fig tree** grows around and slowly replaces its host tree.

---

## ‚úÖ Use Case

- Migrating a **monolith to microservices**
- Replacing a legacy system with a **new tech stack**
- Introducing **Spring Boot services** into old applications

---

## üîÅ How it works (Step-by-Step)

### üß± 1. **Old System is Active**
The legacy app is running in production.

### üîÑ 2. **Introduce a Proxy Layer**
A **facade** or **API Gateway** routes requests.

```text
Client ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Old System (initially)
```

### ‚ú® 3. **New Modules Replacing Legacy**
You replace one feature at a time.

```text
Client ‚Üí API Gateway
            ‚Ü≥ /orders ‚Üí New Microservice
            ‚Ü≥ /users ‚Üí Old Monolith
```

### ‚ùå 4. **Eventually Decommission Old System**
Once all routes/features are replaced.

---

## üì¶ Example in Java / Microservices

Suppose you have a monolith with `/orders`, `/products`, `/users`:

### üîÅ Migration Flow:
```text
Client ‚Üí API Gateway
   ‚Ü≥ /orders   ‚Üí New Spring Boot Microservice
   ‚Ü≥ /users    ‚Üí Legacy Monolith
   ‚Ü≥ /products ‚Üí Legacy Monolith
```

As each module is rewritten:
- You update the routing logic
- No need for a big-bang rewrite
- Rollback and testing become safer

---

## üìê Benefits

- ‚úÖ No downtime during migration
- ‚úÖ Can migrate module-by-module
- ‚úÖ Easier testing and rollback
- ‚úÖ Low risk, high control

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges

- Gateway/Proxy management
- Data consistency between old/new
- Gradual code duplication/refactoring

---

## üß† TL;DR (Interview Style):

> The Strangler Design Pattern is used to **gradually refactor** or replace a legacy system by routing requests to either the old or the new implementation.  
> It enables **safe, incremental migration** and is widely used in **monolith-to-microservice** transitions using an API gateway or fa√ßade.
