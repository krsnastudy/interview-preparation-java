In microservices, **synchronous communication** means that one service sends a request to another and waits for the response. This pattern is commonly used for real-time operations like user authentication, order confirmation, or fetching product details.

---

## âœ… Types of Synchronous Communication (with Examples)

### 1. **HTTP REST API (most common)**

* **Protocol**: HTTP/HTTPS
* **Format**: JSON/XML
* **Tools**: Spring Web, Feign Client, RestTemplate, WebClient

#### ðŸ”¹ Example:

```http
GET /products/123
```

```java
@RestController
public class ProductController {
    @GetMapping("/products/{id}")
    public Product getProduct(@PathVariable Long id) {
        return productService.getProductById(id);
    }
}
```

> **Use case**: A `Cart Service` calls `Product Service` to get product info while building the cart.

---

### 2. **Feign Client (Declarative REST Client)**

* Built on top of REST but makes calling remote services easier.
* Integrates well with Spring Cloud and load balancing (Ribbon/Eureka).

#### ðŸ”¹ Example:

```java
@FeignClient(name = "payment-service")
public interface PaymentClient {
    @PostMapping("/payments")
    PaymentResponse makePayment(PaymentRequest request);
}
```

> **Use case**: `Order Service` uses Feign to call `Payment Service`.

---

### 3. **gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)**

* **Protocol**: HTTP/2
* **Format**: Protobuf (binary, fast)
* Highly efficient and compact compared to REST.

#### ðŸ”¹ Example:

```proto
service UserService {
  rpc GetUser(UserRequest) returns (UserResponse);
}
```

> **Use case**: `Analytics Service` gets real-time metrics from `User Service` with low latency.

---

### 4. **SOAP Web Services (Legacy)**

* **Protocol**: HTTP + XML-based
* Used in older enterprise systems or banking/insurance systems.

#### ðŸ”¹ Example:

```xml
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
   <soapenv:Body>
      <getUserDetails>
         <userId>123</userId>
      </getUserDetails>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
```

> **Use case**: A legacy mainframe system provides user data via SOAP service.

---

### 5. **GraphQL (Advanced APIs)**

* Single endpoint, allows querying exactly what you need.
* Flexible alternative to REST.

#### ðŸ”¹ Example:

```graphql
query {
  product(id: "123") {
    name
    price
    stock
  }
}
```

> **Use case**: `Mobile App` requests tailored data in a single call from `Product Service`.
