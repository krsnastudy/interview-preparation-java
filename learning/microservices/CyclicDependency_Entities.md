**Cyclic dependency in Entities** is a *common problem* especially when entities reference each other bi-directionally (for example, `Employee` â†’ `Department` â†’ `Employee`).  
If not handled properly, it can cause issues like:
- Infinite loops in serialization (like JSON infinite recursion),
- StackOverflowError,
- Hibernate loading issues.

ðŸ‘‰ **Here's how you handle it properly:**

---

### 1. **Use `@JsonManagedReference` and `@JsonBackReference` (Jackson Annotations)**

When you serialize entities (e.g., return JSON via REST API), cyclic references can cause infinite loops.  
Jackson annotations help to manage parent-child relationships.

Example:

```java
@Entity
public class Department {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    private String name;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "department")
    @JsonManagedReference
    private List<Employee> employees;
}
```

```java
@Entity
public class Employee {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    private String name;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "department_id")
    @JsonBackReference
    private Department department;
}
```

âœ… **`@JsonManagedReference`** â†’ Owner side (Parent)  
âœ… **`@JsonBackReference`** â†’ Child side (ignored during serialization)

---

### 2. **Use `@JsonIgnore` on one side**

If you simply want to **ignore one side** during serialization.

```java
@Entity
public class Employee {
    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "department_id")
    @JsonIgnore
    private Department department;
}
```

But **be careful** â€” this will *completely* remove the department info from JSON.

---

### 3. **Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) Approach**

Best practice (especially in **microservices**):  
âž” Don't expose **Entities** directly over APIs.  
âž” Instead, create **DTO classes** and map only the necessary fields.

Example:

```java
public class EmployeeDTO {
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String departmentName;
}
```

Use **ModelMapper** or **MapStruct** to map Entity âž” DTO without circular references.

---

### 4. **Use `@JsonIdentityInfo`**

Instead of removing cycles, you **serialize objects with unique IDs**.

```java
@JsonIdentityInfo(generator = ObjectIdGenerators.PropertyGenerator.class, property = "id")
@Entity
public class Department {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    private String name;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "department")
    private List<Employee> employees;
}
```

Now Jackson will serialize relationships **based on IDs** instead of duplicating entire objects.

---

### 5. **Hibernate Specific: `@Lazy` Loading**

Hibernate also uses **lazy loading** for child collections to avoid unnecessary data fetching.

```java
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "department", fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
private List<Employee> employees;
```

This doesn't solve JSON recursion, but improves **performance and memory**.

# ðŸš€ **Summary**

| Technique | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| `@JsonManagedReference` & `@JsonBackReference` | Handle parent-child serialization safely |
| `@JsonIgnore` | Ignore one side completely during serialization |
| DTO Approach | Best practice to avoid exposing entities directly |
| `@JsonIdentityInfo` | Serialize using IDs to prevent cycles |
| Lazy Loading | Hibernate optimization for associations |

âœ… **Interview Tip:**  
Always say: *"We prefer using DTOs and controlled mapping to avoid cyclic dependencies between entities, especially in a microservices or large-scale application."* ðŸŽ¯

Itâ€™s super useful to answer with a diagram in senior-level interviews! ðŸš€
